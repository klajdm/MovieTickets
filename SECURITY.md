## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Review Requirements

- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities

### Secure Coding Practices

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode output to prevent XSS attacks
- **Authentication**: Never store passwords in plain text
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data

### Dependencies

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable` to check for vulnerabilities

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Areas Requiring Extra Attention

- **File Upload**: If file upload functionality is added, implement proper validation
- **Payment Processing**: Ensure PCI compliance if payment features are added
- **API Endpoints**: Secure all API endpoints with proper authentication
- **Database Access**: Use least privilege principle for database connections

### Configuration Security

- Store sensitive configuration in secure locations (Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Use environment variables for secrets in development
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Implement proper connection string security

## 📋 Security Checklist for Releases
